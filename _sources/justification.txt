Project Justification
=====================

Emoji are undoubtedly now a solid part of language and online communication. Able to communicate complex ideas and subtlety in an incredibly information dense way. However, if the recipient of the message were to see only boxes, or other placeholder characters, the message is lost.::

  "ðŸ‘€ We need to talk â˜•, this lunchtime." â†’ "ï¿½ We need to talk â–¡, this lunchtime."

One project that has most assuredly aided in the availability of emoji is the Twemoji project, serving users not only of Twitter but also platforms such as discord.

Emoji design is as complex as the work of a font house. Characters must be discernible, and simple to read at speed. Twemoji achieves this, I believe, with its strong use of simple shapes and bold colours. These colours are what this project concerns itself with. It's my belief that the set can be unified and refined, removing unnecessary colours and adopting a definitive palette.

I believe this not only would aid in enforcing the cohesive style, but also serve as a useful tool for future designers, offering a clear colour set within which to work.

Refinement steps have been undertaken in the history of the Twemoji project, tweaking position within the frame, for example. This project aims to be the largest scale change thus far, taking a data driven approach to analyse and tweak the thousands of emoji currently supported.
